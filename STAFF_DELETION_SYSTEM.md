# Staff Deletion System

## Overview
This system provides a better approach to staff management by separating staff records from login credentials. This allows you to delete staff records without affecting the user's ability to log in.

## Key Features

### 1. **Separate Staff Records from Login Credentials**
- Staff records are stored in the `Worker` model
- Login credentials are stored in the `User` model
- Deleting a staff record does NOT delete the login account

### 2. **Soft Deletion**
- Staff records are marked as deleted (`isDeleted: true`) instead of being permanently removed
- Deleted records can be restored if needed
- Login credentials remain intact

### 3. **Three Types of Deletion**

#### **Soft Delete (Recommended)**
- Marks staff record as deleted
- Preserves all data for potential restoration
- User can still log in but loses staff access
- Can be restored later

#### **Permanent Delete (Admin Only)**
- Completely removes the staff record from database
- Cannot be undone
- Login credentials still preserved
- Use with extreme caution

#### **Status Management**
- Activate/Deactivate staff records
- Staff can be temporarily disabled without deletion

## API Endpoints

### Staff Record Management
- `GET /api/staff-records` - List all staff records
- `GET /api/staff-records/:id` - Get specific staff record
- `DELETE /api/staff-records/:id` - Soft delete staff record
- `PUT /api/staff-records/:id/restore` - Restore deleted record
- `DELETE /api/staff-records/:id/permanent` - Permanently delete (admin only)
- `PUT /api/staff-records/:id/status` - Update status (activate/deactivate)

## Frontend Components

### AdminStaff.js
- Enhanced with validation and confirmation dialogs
- Link to staff record management

### StaffRecordManagement.js
- Complete staff record management interface
- Filter by status (active, inactive, deleted)
- Soft delete, restore, and permanent delete options
- Status management (activate/deactivate)

## Database Schema Changes

### Worker Model Additions
```javascript
// Soft deletion fields
isDeleted: { type: Boolean, default: false, index: true },
deletedAt: { type: Date, default: null },
deletedBy: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' },
deletionReason: { type: String, default: '' },

// Status management
statusUpdatedAt: { type: Date, default: null },
statusUpdatedBy: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' },
statusReason: { type: String, default: '' },

// Restoration fields
restoredAt: { type: Date, default: null },
restoredBy: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' },
```

## Usage Examples

### Soft Delete a Staff Record
```javascript
// Frontend
await deleteStaffRecord(staffId, 'Staff resigned');

// Backend response
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Staff record deleted successfully",
  "data": {
    "staffId": "STF123456",
    "deletedAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
    "reason": "Staff resigned"
  }
}
```

### Restore a Deleted Record
```javascript
// Frontend
await restoreStaffRecord(staffId);

// Backend response
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Staff record restored successfully",
  "data": {
    "staffId": "STF123456",
    "restoredAt": "2024-01-15T11:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Preserves Login Access**: Users can still log in even after staff record deletion
2. **Data Recovery**: Soft deleted records can be restored
3. **Audit Trail**: Complete history of deletions and restorations
4. **Flexible Management**: Multiple ways to manage staff access
5. **Security**: Prevents accidental permanent deletion

## Migration Notes

- Existing staff records will have `isDeleted: false` by default
- No data loss during migration
- All existing functionality remains intact
- New features are additive, not replacing existing functionality

## Security Considerations

- Only admins and managers can manage staff records
- Permanent deletion requires admin role
- All actions are logged with user information
- Soft deletion is the recommended approach
- Permanent deletion should be used sparingly
